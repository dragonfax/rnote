This project is not ready for primetime. I'm using it myself daily for personal note taking, but it still has a lot of holes in its interface.


Pay Features
----

NOTE: no Evernote 'pay' features are supported or re-implemented by this interface.



What Works
---

* login/logout (w/ username,password and consumer key, or developer token)
* creating and editing notes
* searching for notes
* deleting notes

Take a look at the feature tests to see whats been implemented, and example syntax.

What Doesn't Work
---

Anything listed in 'interface' but that doesn't yet have a feature test written for it.

TODO
---

* [ ] Anything from 'interface' not yet implemented
* [ ] using the 'revokeLongSession' api method to implement a proper 'logout'
* [ ] additional format options (only txt for now, and markdown isn't really implemented)
* [ ] the entire tool is too slow
* [ ] improve search result display formating
