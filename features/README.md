==========

The features for this project, should act as documentation of the command line arguments an the interface.
So its important that they actually contain the command line used for each test.

These features are also made to run against the public Evernote Sandbox.
So they probaly shouldn't be launched by an automated system. But manually launched is fine.

All this combines to give us a few odd steps in the features. That normally would be against best Cucumber practices.
